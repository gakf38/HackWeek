# HackWeek
A Github repository of a University of Missouri CS 4830 Hack Week Project

<h2>Project</h2>
This project was an attempt to make a web chat app that would allow for the ranking of posts real time.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
We used NodeJs with libraries Socket.io and ExpressJs, MongoDB, and hosted on an Azure Server.

<h2>What works</h2>
Techincally we completed our goal for this project. We have a web chat app that connects to a MongoDB backend that allows for users to send messages and vote on posts.

<h2>What does not work</h2>
Technically we completed out goal for this project. What we did not do as origanally planned was update the list based on rankings in real time. A workaround we came up with was to reload the page on rankings. This was done because of time constarints.
